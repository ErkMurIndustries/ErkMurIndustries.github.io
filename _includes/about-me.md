## Welcome!

In case you haven’t guessed it yet, my name is Erik Murray. For the past eight years, I’ve been honing my skills as a broadcast maintenance engineer for New York Public Radio. Aside from the day to day routine, this path has led me down many exciting avenues.

#### Design Work
I’ve designed and fabricated intricate wiring projects using AutoCAD, solder, and no lack of wire ties. Fun fact, I shot the background picture from the window of WNYC’s transmitter room in the Empire State Building during the installation of a transmitter control system.

#### PRTG
I’ve harnessed Paessler’s PRTG software, a network management system, to gain us visibility on our equipment both local and remote. Utilizing SNMP and Python scripting, I’ve mapped out a system that provides verbose timestamped event logs capable of providing historic data. It has been invaluable for troubleshooting issues and detecting early warning signs of systems.

#### Transmitter Reading App
Most recently, I have been developing a Flask web app to digitally sign our transmitter readings. Believe it or not, we have been physically writing down the legally required readings on paper this whole time. Considering the fact that we have eight radio stations, that’s four sheets of paper. Every day. That need to be stored for two years. Needless to say, that’s a lot of real estate and man power. We are about to start beta testing this app which would reduce all of the paper and pen strokes to a few mouse clicks.

#### This Website
I built this website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript as a way to hone my front-end fundamentals. While I have experience with other frameworks, I believe it's crucial to understand the basics before relying on such tools. Please note that this site is still in beta, and much of the content is hidden. Nevertheless, I hope that this page provides insight into the wide range of work I am capable of accomplishing.
