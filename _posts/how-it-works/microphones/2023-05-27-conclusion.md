# Conclusion
                
Media has never been the same since the invention of the microphone. With the ability to transmit sound waves by radio waves or even just to amplify an oratorâ€™s voice in a hall, we have gained so much from this incredible tool. From the age old tin can on a string to the microphones used in professional recording studios, the science of microphone electronics has jumped leaps and bounds. While they come in all shapes, sizes, styles, and designs; microphones have created a world of music and media that never could have been conceived of in the past.
