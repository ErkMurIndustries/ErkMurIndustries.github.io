# Condenser Microphones

### Definition
Another genre of microphone is the condenser microphone. These microphones use capacitance to incite an output voltage. Essentially, the capsule is created using two charged plates with dielectric material between them. One of these plates is fixed while the other is movable. The movable plate in this instance is in fact a plastic diaphragm coated in a thin layer of gold to make it conductive. 

### How it Works
If we consider the formula: C = (eKA)/d, where e is the charge of an electron, K is the dielectric constant, A is the area of the plates, and d is the distance between the plates, one can see that changing the distance between the plates will directly affect the capacitance produced. As the plates are pushed closer together, the voltage increases. Condensers have a very high impedance at the capsule. They use a step down transformer to work more efficiently with their build in preamplifiers. 

### Phantom Power
Condensers require an external power source to run properly. This power source is referred to as phantom power. “Phantom” because it is a DC input of 48 volts that runs along the AC output coming through a specific pin on the microphone connection. This voltage powers the on board preamp, as well as providing a charge for the plates of the capsule. 

### Why Use a Condenser Mic
Condenser microphones are known for having a very smooth, bright frequency response with a high output and quick transient response. While every mic has its strong suits these are most often used in recording studios.
