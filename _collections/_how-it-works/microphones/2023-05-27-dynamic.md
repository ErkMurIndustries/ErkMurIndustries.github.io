# Dynamic Microphones 

Moving coil microphones are also considered dynamic microphones. They work on the same principle of electromagnetism as ribbon mics using a slightly different construction. With moving coil design, a coil of wire is attached to a plastic diaphragm that is free to move back and forth. The coil slides along a magnet as the diaphragm moves with acoustical energy a voltage is produced across the wire. 

As the coil has more mass than that of a ribbon, the transient response is slower considering the attack must be much more powerful to move the coil as much. However, due to the winding of the coil, the output produced from the coil is much higher. Moving coil microphones are also much more rugged than their frail ribbon mic counterparts. The ribbon is prone to being knocked out of its magnetic field or otherwise damaged from simply too much air passing it, while the wound coil is much more durable. There are even youtube videos where people run them over with trucks or use them as hammers and they still work!
