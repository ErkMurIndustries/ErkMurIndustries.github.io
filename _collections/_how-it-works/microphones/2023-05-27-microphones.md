# What is a Microphone? 
{:.no-toc}

The invention of the microphone opened up the world to mass media. Without the ability to transform acoustic energy into electrical energy, there would be no radio broadcasts or loud rock concerts. This electroacoustic development was no easy feat, but through the brains of many fine physicists, the microphone became a reality. Since its inception, the microphone has taken on many forms â€“ each with its own defining characteristics. From ribbons to condensers, the world of microphone electronics is a complex science of electronics and acoustics.

## Transducers
To understand the microphone, we must first understand the concept of a transducer. A transducer is an object that takes one form of energy and converts it into another. A simple example of a transducer is that of two tin cans on a string. The cans turn the acoustic energy of a spoken word into mechanical energy as it vibrates through the string and then process is reversed by the opposite can. 

In the case of a microphone, we are converting acoustic energy into electric energy by a slightly more complicated process. Imagine a circuit consisting of a DC power source and two resistors in series. The first resistor is variable while the second is fixed. As the value of the first resistor is varied, the voltage over the second resistor also fluctuates. If the first resistor varies in time with an acoustic input and we take the voltage output over the second resistor, the electrical output is a representation of the acoustic energy inputted. At this point, we just need to replace the first resistor with an acoustic device that can vary the resistance and we have a functional microphone.

## The First Microphone
The carbon microphone was the first working design of an electroacoustic transducer. This format of microphone was used in the first radio broadcast and is still found in some phone receivers. Essentially, this design replaces the first resistor of the previously talked about circuit with a pocket of carbon particles attached to a diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates with incoming acoustic waves and causes the carbon particles to expand and contract with the incoming air propagations. The compression and expansion of the charged carbon particles creates a varying resistance that creates a voltage over the secondary resistor.

## Power Transference
As we know, maximum power transfer occurs when the impedance of the load is equal to source impedance. The same holds true in microphone design. Usually the capsules have a differing output than the preamp they feed into. On account of this fact, most microphones have on board transformers to help better transfer the signal. Not only do these transformers help match impedances, but they usually provide an increase in the output of the microphone as they step up the voltage of the microphone signal.
